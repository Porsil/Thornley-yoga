-   **Studio Section**

    -   The studio section allows the user to learn some basic information about the yoga studio and the experience of practising yoga here.
    -   This section explains to the user that all experience levels are catered for to encourage all user levels to consider practising at the studio.
    -   Included are supporting images of the yoga studio to allow the user to see what the studio and classes look like.
    -   On large screens, three pictures are visible to allow best use of the space.
    -   When the screen size is reduced to below 875px wide the middle image is removed and on small screens below 650px the layout is aligned vertically. This is to avoid the screen being too crowded.
